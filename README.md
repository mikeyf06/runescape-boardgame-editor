# RuneScape Boardgame Editor (Web Version)

This tool was created to quickly mark up a game board for RuneScape players. It currently supports two simple features:

- **Draw Lines**: Use your mouse to draw lines directly on the board.
- **Add Red Circles**: Click anywhere on the board to place semi-transparent red circles.

Very early and quick implementation, planning on iterating on this in the future.
