# RuneScape Boardgame Editor (WebApp)

This tool was created to quickly mark up a game board for RuneScape players. It currently supports two simple features:

- **Draw Lines**: Use your mouse to draw lines directly on the board.
- **Add Red Circles**: Click anywhere on the board to place semi-transparent red circles.

Very early and quick implementation, planning on iterating on this in the future.



# Notes:

Web is the best platform for this currently, this is not mobile friendly at all yet. Those updates will be coming soon.

# Planned Improvements:

- *Drawing object types*: 
    - Ability to select various object markers and apply those to images. Ex: X, Check, Arrow, etc
- *Undo/Redo Buttons*
- Better responsiveness for various screen sizes
- Drag & Drop upload
